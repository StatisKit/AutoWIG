## Documentation

Official documentation is available at [virtualplants.github.io](http://virtualplants.github.io)

## Install

To install VPlants.AutoWIG, you need to install these dependencies:
  - LLVM (https://github.com/llvm-mirror/llvm),
  - Clang (https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang),
  - Zlib (http://www.zlib.net/),
  - Boost.Python (https://github.com/boostorg/python),
  - Mako Templates (http://www.makotemplates.org/).
  - OpenAlea.OpenAlea (https://github.com/openalea/openalea)

Note that in order to benefit from an efficient front-end such as PyClangLite you need to install it (https://github.com/VirtualPlants/pyclanglite) and therefore it is recommanded to install LLVM and Clant using the herein described procedure.

You will probably need to copy the Clang python bindings (libclang) into your Python library directory or change your PYTHONPATH.
