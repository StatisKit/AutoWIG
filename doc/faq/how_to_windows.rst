How to install **AutoWIG** on Windows ?
=======================================

Currently, **AutoWIG** is not supported on Windows.
However, *Windows 10â€™s Anniversary Update* offers a `ubuntu based shell <https://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/commandline/wsl/install_guide>`_.
This shell can therefore be used to install **AutoWIG** on your Windows machine without requiring to install a Linux virtual machine.
One this shell is launched, please follow the :ref:`install-source` procedure.
