Examples
========

.. note::

   In the following section, we present some examples using **AutoWIG** in order to emphasize particular aspects of the wrapping process.
   This examples can be executed on-line on a `Binder server <http://mybinder.org/repo/statiskit/autowig>`_.
   They can be found in the `doc/examples` directory and are recognizable by their :code:`*.ipynb` extension.
  
.. warning::

  Binder does not provide webhooks that could allow to rebuild the **Docker** image at each changes.
  In order to able to run these examples, it is possible that you need to rebuild the **Docker** image.
  For this, go to the `Binder status page <http://mybinder.org/status/statiskit/autowig>`_ and click on on the `rebuild` button.

Here are the pre-executed examples:
