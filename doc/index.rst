High-level programming languages, like *Python* and *R*, are popular among scientists.
They tend to be concise and readable, leading to a rapid development cycle, but suffer from performance drawback compare to compiled language. 
However, these languages allow to interface *C*, *C++* and *Fortran* code.
By this way, most of the scientific packages incorporate compiled scientific libraries to both speed up the code and reuse legacy libraries.
While several semi-automatic solutions and tools exist to wrap these compiled libraries, the process of wrapping a large library is cumbersome and time consuming.
In this paper, we introduce **AutoWIG**, a *Python* library that wraps automatically *C++* libraries into high-level languages.
Our solution consists in parsing *C++*  code using **LLVM**/**CLang** technology and generating the wrappers using the **Mako** templating engine.
Our approach is automatic, extensible, and can scale from simple *C++* libraries to very complex ones, composed of thousands of classes or using modern meta-programming constructs.
The usage and extension of **AutoWIG** is also illustrated on a set of statistical libraries.
