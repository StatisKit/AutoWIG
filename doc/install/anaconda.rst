Installation from binaries
==========================
    
In order to ease the installation of the **AutoWIG** software on multiple operating systems, the **Conda** package and environment management system is used.
To install **Conda**, please refers to its `documentation <http://conda.pydata.org/docs>`_ or follow the installation instructions given on the **StatisKit** `documentation <https://statiskit.rtfd.io>`_.
Once **Conda** is installed, you can install **AutoWIG** binaries into a special environment that will be used for wrapper generation by typing the following command line in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    conda create -n autowig python-autowig -c statiskit

.. warning::

    When compiling wrappers generated by **AutoWIG** in its environment some issues can be encountered at compile time or run time (from within the *Python* interpreter) due to compiler or dependency incompatibilies.
    This is why it is recommended to install **AutoWIG** in a separate environment that will only be used for wrappers' generation.
    If the problem persits, please refers to the **StatisKit** `documentation <http://statiskit.rtfd.io>`_ concerning the configuration of the development environment.
